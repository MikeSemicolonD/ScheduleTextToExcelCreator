About:
	This is meant to provide a guide on how to copy your student schedule and paste it in a way so that my program's 'standard' parser could get understand it.
	This guide is meant to simplify the process down to just simple copying and pasting. You shouldn't have to add or remove any text yourself.
	
Directions:
	Step 1: Go to your schedule for the semester.
	Step 2: Copy all the information for each class.
	Step 3: Open up a new text file (Or the program) and paste it.
	Step 4: Navigate to each class page in your schedule and copy the name and email of the professor.
	Step 5: Select the word "New".
	Step 6: Paste the name and email of your professor.
	Step 7: Repeat for every class until you're done.
	Step 8: Load your file into my program. Select a directory to store your Excel File, then click 'Export'.
