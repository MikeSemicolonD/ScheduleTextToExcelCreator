# Schedule Text To Excel Creator

## Description :
  A simple project I started during winter break. My intention was to make an application that'll allow me to more easily create an Excel sheet that represents my schedule. 

## Why? :
  Before this program I'd have to painstakingly make these excel sheets myself. But now this program automates that process. It allow me to easily copy and paste data from my school profile into a text file with a consistent format/pattern, where the program will then parse out the data and allow me to export it to Excel.

## Where? :
  An .exe is accessible at this address: "Schedule_Text_To_Excel_Creator/ScheduleCreator/ScheduleCreator/ScheduleCreator/bin/Debug/".

## "This Guide is Dumb" :
  Don't worry, I've recently updated the program to support logging in to your student account and getting the data directly from mySNHU. It works and it's glorious. Unfortunately due to the coming semester, and how this project relates to other student projects. I'm holding off on pushing this recent update until after the semester ends.
